Deputies allege that one at a time, the Pines approached the officers, prompting them to open fire. The Prines later died at the hospital. The lawsuit filed by Deborah’s mother, Patricia Doyle, presented a different version of events. Doyle said she called the police to report that her daughter and son-in-law were fighting, and that her daughter was going to purposefully try to gett the deputies to shoot her. After deputies arrived, Prine walked out of the house with a rifle strapped to her shoulder. Deputies told her to drop her weapon, but Deputy Christopher Powell and Sergeant Richard Dubus shot her before she had time to comply. When Deborah hit the ground, Dubus and deputies Turner Barran and Bailey Newsom “fired a second round into her.” After witnessing his wife being shot, Robert Prine ran from the house towards his wife’s body. He was reportedly screaming and unarmed when deputies shot him. The deputies identified as being involved in the death of Robert Prine are Dubus, Powell, and Deputy Mark Ceravolo.
